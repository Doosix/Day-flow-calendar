    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to ensure security, scalability, and ease of debugging, adhering to the core design principles of Authorization Independence, Clarity of Intent, DBAC (Database-Based Access Control), and QAPs (Rules are not Filters). It leverages structural segregation and access modeling for enhanced security rule management.\n\n**Authorization Independence:** Achieved primarily through path-based ownership for user-specific data. This approach eliminates the need for complex `get()` calls in security rules, ensuring atomic operations and simplifying debugging.\n\n**Structural Segregation:** User-owned data (events) is stored under `/users/{userId}/events/{eventId}`, providing a clear segregation of access needs based on user ownership.\n\n**Access Modeling:**\n*   **Private Data:** Events are owned by users and stored under their respective user document, thus the data is private.\n\n**QAPs Support:** The structure is designed to support secure `list` operations. Since the data is segregated based on user ID in its own collection, listing events for a specific user is straightforward and secure.\n\nThe design favors path-based ownership for `events`, leading to simple and efficient security rules."
